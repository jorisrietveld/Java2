# Assignment solutions
 - **5.1 look around**
   - Done 
 
 - **5.2 Investigate the String documentation. Then look at the documentation for some other classes.**
   - **What is the structure of class documentation?**
     - The name of the class
     - An general explanation about the class.
   - **Which sections are common to all class descriptions?**
     An general description about the class, throws info, return types and arguments.
   - **What is their purpose?**
     - Explaining the Java API
   - **The common structure of all class documentation is:**
     - Documentation about the classes attributes: An description and type.
     - Documentation about the classes methods: overloads, return types and what arguments they take.
     - Documentation about the classes Constructors and destructors: an Description, overloads, and what arguments they take.
     
 - **5.3 Look up the startsWith method in the documentation for String. There are two versions. Describe in your own 
    words what they do and the differences between them.**
   - Both take an string as first argument, the optional integer argument shifts the index from witch the 
   sequence gets matched.
   
 - **5.4 Is there a method in the String class that tests whether a string ends with a given suffix? 
       If so, what is it called and what are its parameters and return type?**
   - Jep, 
   ```java 
   String.endsWith( surfix ) 
   ```
   
 - **5.5 Is there a method in the String class that returns the number of characters in the string? 
       If so, what is it called and what are its parameters?**
   - Jep, 
     ```java 
     String.length() 
     ```
   
 - **5.6 If  you  found  methods  for  the  two  tasks  above,  how  did  you  find  them?  Is  it  easy or hard to 
    find methods you are looking for? Why?**
    - Intellij auto complete and crtl+Q
    
 - **5.7 Find the trim method in the String class’s documentation. Write down the signature of that method. Write down 
    an example call to that method on a String variable called text.**
    - The signature of the trim method: public String trim()
        ```java
        class Test{ 
            private void test(){
                String text = "  Some Text!  ";
                System.out.println( text.trim() );
        }}
        ```
 - **5.8 Implement this improvement in your version of the tech-support1 project. Test it to confirm that it is 
    tolerant of extra space around the word ‘bye’.** 
   - Done see file [see file](main/SupportSystem.java), line 43
 
 - **5.9 Improve the code of the SupportSystem class in the tech-support1 project so that case in the input is ignored. 
    Use the String class’s toLowerCase method to do this. Remember that this method will not actually change the String 
    it is called on, but result in the creation of a new one being created with slightly different contents.** 
   - Done see file [see file](main/SupportSystem.java), line 43
 
 - **5.10 Find the equals method in the documentation for class String . What is the return type of this method?**
    - ```
     boolean
     ```
 
 - **5.11 Change your implementation to use the equals method instead of startsWith .**
   - Done see file [see file](main/SupportSystem.java), line 45
 
 - **5.12 Find the class Random in the Java class library documentation. Which pack- age is it in? What does it do? 
    How do you construct an instance? How do you generate a random number? Note that you will probably not understand 
    everything that is stated in the documentation. Just try to find out what you need to know.**
    - Random is in package: `java.util.Random`
    - It gets pseudo-random numbers.
   
 - **5.13 Write a small code fragment (on paper) that generates a random integer number using this class.**
    - Getting an random integer: 
        ```java
        class Test{ 
            private int getInteger(){ 
                Random notSoRandomIfYouAskMe = new Random();
                return notSoRandomIfYouAskMe.nextLong();
        }}
        ```
    
 - **5.14 Write some code (in BlueJ) to test the generation of random numbers. To do this, create a new class called 
     RandomTester . You can create this class in the tech-support1 project, or you can create a new project for it—it 
     doesn’t matter. In class RandomTester , implement two methods: printOneRandom (which prints out one random number) 
     and printMultiRandom(int howMany) (which has a parameter to specify how many num- bers you want, and then prints 
     out the appropriate number of random numbers).**  
    ```java
    class RandomTester{ 
        private java.security.SecureRandom secureRandom = new java.security.SecureRandom();
     
        public void printOneRandom(){
            System.out.printf( "Pseudo-random number generated: %d", secureRandom.nextInt() );
        }
        public void printMultiRandom( int howMany ){
            System.out.println( "Printing %d pseudo-random numbers for the win:" );
            secureRandom.ints( howMany ).forEach( System.out::println );
    }}
    ```
   
 - 5.15 **Find the nextInt method in class Random that allows the target range of random numbers to be specified. 
    What are the possible random numbers that are generated when you call this method with 100 as its parameter?**
    - The number range `[0-99]` because its 0 inclusive to the number specified as argument exclusive.
    
 - 5.16 **Write a method in your RandomTester class called throwDice that re- turns a random number between 1 and 6 (inclusive).**
    ```java
    class RandomTester{ 
        private java.security.SecureRandom secureRandom = new java.security.SecureRandom();
        
        public void printOneRandom(){
            System.out.printf( "Pseudo-random number generated: %d", secureRandom.nextInt() );
        }
        public void printMultiRandom( int howMany ){
            System.out.println( "Printing %d pseudo-random numbers for the win:" );
            secureRandom.ints( howMany ).forEach( System.out::println );
        }
        public int throwDice(){
            return secureRandom.nextInt( 7 );
        }
    }
    ```
    
 - 5.17 **Write a method called getResponse that randomly returns one of the strings "yes" , "no" , or "maybe" .**
    ```java
    class RandomTester{ 
        private java.security.SecureRandom secureRandom = new java.security.SecureRandom();
     
        public String getResponse()
        {
           int randomNumber = secureRandom.nextInt( 3 ); 
           return randomNumber == 2 ? "maybe" : randomNumber ? "no" : "yes";
        }
    }
    ```
 - 5.18 **Extend your getResponse method so that it uses an ArrayList to store an arbitrary number of responses and randomly returns one of them.**
    ```java
        class RandomTester{ 
            private java.security.SecureRandom secureRandom = new java.security.SecureRandom();
            private java.util.ArrayList<String> response = new ArrayList<>() {{
                add("Some response");
                add("Some other response");
                add("Tunderdome 25 Years of hardcore!!!"); 
                add("Hack The Plannet!");
            }};
         
            public String getResponse(){
               return response.get( secureRandom.nextInt( response.size() -1 )  );
            }
        }
    ```
    
 - 5.19 **Add a method to your RandomTester class that takes a parameter max and generates a random number in the range 1 to max (inclusive).**
    ```java
        class RandomTester{ 
            private java.security.SecureRandom secureRandom = new java.security.SecureRandom();
            
            public int getRandomInt( int maxInclusive ){
               return secureRandom.nextInt( ++maxInclusive );
            }
        }
    ```
    
 - 5.20 **Add a method to your RandomTester class that takes two parameters, min and max , and generates a random number in the 
    range min to max (inclusive). Rewrite the body of the method you wrote for the previous exercise so that it now calls this 
    new method to generate its result. Note that it should not be necessary to use a loop in this method.**
     ```java
            class RandomTester{ 
                private java.security.SecureRandom secureRandom = new java.security.SecureRandom();
                
                public int getRandomInt( int minInclusive, int maxInclusive ){
                   return secureRandom.nextInt( maxInclusive - minInclusive ) + minInclusive;
                }
            }
    ```
     
 - 5.21 **Implement in your version of the tech-support system the random-response solution discussed here.**
   - Done see file [see file](main/SupportSystem.java)

 - 5.22 **What happens when you add more (or fewer) possible responses to the responses list? Will the selection of a random response still work properly? Why or why not?**
   - Doesn't matter because the random generator gets the size of the array list.

 - 5.23 **What is a HashMap ? What is its purpose and how do you use it? Answer these questions in writing, and use the Java library documentation of Map and HashMap for your responses. Note that you will find it hard to understand everything, as the documentation for these classes is not very good. We will discuss the details later in this chapter, but see what you can find out on your own before reading on.**
   - An collection (associate array). You use named keys to store an value, like joris => 21.
 
 - 5.24 **HashMap is a parameterized class. List those of its methods that depend on the types used to parameterize it. Do you think the same type could be used for both of its parameters?**
   Anny object, Yep that is possible.
   
 - 5.25 **How do you check how many entries are contained in a map?**
    ```java
        class Test{
            public mapSize(){  
               java.util.Map<String, Integer> fcksGiven = new Map<>();
               System.out.printf( "Today there are %d ", fcksGiven.size() );
            }
        }
    ```
     
 - 5.26 **Create a class MapTester (either in your current project or in a new project).In it, use a HashMap to 
        implement a phone book similar to the one in the example above. (Remember that you must import java.util.HashMap .) 
        In this class, implement two methods:**
    ```
    public void enterNumber(String name, String number);
    public String lookupNumber(String name);
    ```
    - Done see file [see file](main/PhoneBook.java)

 
 - 5.27 **What happens when you add an entry to a map with a key that already ex- ists in the map?**
   - It will override the current value.
 
 - 5.28 **What happens when you add an entry to a map with two different keys?**
   - You get 2 reference's.
   
 - 5.29 **How do you check whether a given key is contained in a map? (Give a Java code example.)**
    ```java
    class Test{
        private HashMap<String, String> peopleTrackedByTheNSA = new HashMap<String, String>(){{
            //   (name,    is being tracked?)
            put( "Snowden", "Yes" );
            put( "Assange", "Yes" );
        }};
    
        public void areYouBeingTracked( String yourName ){
            System.out.println( peopleTrackedByTheNSA.getOrDefault( yourName, "Probably yes" ) );
        }
    }
    ```
 - 5.30 **What happens when you try to look up a value and the key does not exist in the map?**
    You get `null` back. You could use `getOrDefault( key, defaultReturnValue )` if you want something different.
 
 - 5.31 **How do you check how many entries are contained in a map?**
    ```java
        class Test{
            private HashMap<String, String> peopleTrackedByTheNSA = new HashMap<String, String>(){{
                //   (name,    is being tracked?)
                put( "Snowden", "Yes" );
                put( "Assange", "Yes" );
            }};
        
            public void getDatabaseSize( String yourName ){
                System.out.println( peopleTrackedByTheNSA.size() );
            }
        }
    ```
 
 - 5.32 **How do you print out all keys currently stored in a map?**
    ```java
        class Test{
            private HashMap<String, String> peopleTrackedByTheNSA = new HashMap<String, String>(); // Contains half the planets population.
        
            public void printListOfDangerousPeople( String yourName ){
                 peopleTrackedByTheNSA.keySet().forEach( System.out::println );
            }
        }
  
 - 5.33 **Implement the changes discussed here in your own version of the TechSupport system. Test it to get a feel for how well it works.**
   - Done see file [see file](main/SupportSystem.java)
   
 - 5.34 **What are the similarities and differences between a HashSet and an ArrayList ? Use the descriptions of Set , HashSet , List , and ArrayList in the library documentation to find out, because HashSet is a special case of a Set and ArrayList is a special case of a List .**
   - An `List` is an ordered collection.
   - An `Set` is an collection with unique key => value pairs, it can be ordered based on its implementation.
   - An `HashSet` is an unordered collection that cannot be accessed by index but by an custom key value.
   - An `ArrayList` is an Ordered collection that can be accessed by index.
   
 - 5.35 **The split method is more powerful than it first seems from our example. How can you define exactly how a string should be split? Give some examples.**
    With `regular expressions` :sad:
    ```java
    class Test{
        public String someString = "Hello-world this Is Some 123 message! what ever the *A** that means...";
        
        public void terminalSpam(){
            java.util.Arrays.stream( someString.split( "!" ) ).forEach( System.out::println );
            // expected output:
            // Hello-world this Is Some 123 message
            // what ever the *A** that means...
            
            java.util.Arrays.stream( someString.split( "\\S+" ) ).forEach( System.out::println );
            // expected output:
            // Hello-world
            // this 
            // Is 
            // Some 
            // 123 
            // message
            // what 
            // ever 
            // the 
            // *A** 
            // that 
            // means...
        }
    }
    ``` 
    
 - 5.36 **How would you call the split method if you wanted to split a string at either space or tab characters? 
        How might you break up a string in which the words are separated by colon characters (:)?**
```java
class Test{
    public String someString = "Hello beer beer     beer!";
    
    public void terminalSpam(){
        java.util.Arrays.stream( someString.split( "\\s+" ) ).forEach( System.out::println );
        // expected output:
        // Hello 
        // beer 
        // beer 
        // beer!
        
        someString = "Why:not:replace:spaces:With:";
        java.util.Arrays.stream( someString.split( ":" ) ).forEach( System.out::println );
        // expected output: 
        // Why 
        // not 
        // replace 
        // spaces 
        // With
    }
}
``` 
 - 5.37 **What is the difference in the result of returning the words in a HashSet compared with returning them in an ArrayList ?**
   - In the hash set you can receive values by the hash (user defined key) and with an array list you receive them by 
   the integer index that is generated at creation.
   
 - 5.38 **What happens if there is more than one space between two words (e.g., two or three spaces)? Is there a problem?**
  - Nope not a problem if you use the `+` character after the regular expression.
  
 - 5.42 **Implement the final changes discussed above in your own version of the program**
   - Done, see [the Responder class](main/Responder.java) for the implementation.
 
 - 5.41 **Add more word/response mappings into your application. You could copy some out of the solutions provided and add some yourself.**
   - Done, see [the Responder class](main/Responder.java) for the implementation.
 
 - 5.42 **Ensure that the same default response is never repeated twice in a row.**
   - Done, see [the Responder class](main/Responder.java) for the implementation.
 
 - 5.43 **Sometimes two words (or variations of a word) are mapped to the same response. Deal with this by mapping synonyms or related expressions to the same string so that you do not need multiple entries in the response map for the same response.**
   - Done, see [the Responder class](main/Responder.java) for the implementation.
 
 - 5.46 **Use BlueJ’s Project Documentation function to generate documentation for your TechSupport project. Examine it. Is it accurate? Is it complete? Which parts are useful? Which are not? Do you find any errors in the documentation?**
   - Done, see [the Responder class](main/Responder.java) for the implementation. 
 
 - 5.47 **Find examples of javadoc key symbols in the source code of the TechSupport project. How do they influence the formatting of the documentation?**
   - They have a different color ith inteliij IDEA
 
 - 5.48 **Find out about and describe other javadoc key symbols. One place where you can look is the online documentation of Oracle’s Java distribution. It contains a document called javadoc – The Java API Documentation Generator (for example, at http:// download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/technotes/tools/windows/javadoc. html). In this document, the key symbols are called javadoc tags .**
   - `@param` Defines an argument of an method. Or aan class attribute.
   - `@returns` Defines an return type of an method.
   - `@throws` Defines the exceptions an method can throw.
   
 - 5.49 **Properly document all classes in your version of the TechSupport project**
   - Done, see [the Responder class](main/Responder.java) and [the InputReader class](main/InputReader.java) and [the SupportSystem class](main/SupportSystem.java). 
 
 - 5.50 **Create a DrawDemo object and experiment with its various methods. Read the DrawDemo source code 
        and describe (in writing) how each method works.**
   - 
   
 - 5.51 **Create a Pen object interactively using its default constructor (the construc- tor without parameters). 
        Experiment with its methods. While you do this, make sure to have a window open showing you the documentation 
        of the Pen class (either the editor window in Documentation view or a web-browser window showing the project documentation). 
        Refer to the documentation to be certain what each method does.**
     - The constructor `public DrawDemo()` initiates the class.
     - The method `drawSquare()` moves the blue pen to the canvas and calls the square method. 
     - The method `square( Pen pen )` takes the pen and moves it a 100 pixels 4 times making a 90 degree turn after every 
       move. resulting in an square shape on the canvas
     - The method ` drawWheel()`  moves the red pen to the canvas and repeatedly calls the square method, while turning
        10 degrees after every square.
     - The method `colorScribble()` draws random stripes on the canvas in different shades of red, green an blue.
     - The method `clear()` doest like art and feels like erasing it from human history.
     
 - 5.52 **Interactively create an instance of class Canvas and try some of its meth- ods. Again, refer to the 
        class’s documentation while you do this.**
      - Done see [CanvasDemo](Test/Scribble/CanvasDemo.java)
 
 - 5.53 **Find some uses of the color constants in the code of class DrawDemo .**
      - It sets the color of the `Graphics2D.drawLine()` method called. 
 
 - 5.54 **Write down four more color constants that are available in the Color class. Refer to the class’s 
        documentation to find out what they are.**

      - `java.awt.Color.magenta`
      - `java.awt.Color.cyan`
 
 - 5.55 **Create a canvas. Using the canvas’s methods interactively, draw a red circle near the center of the 
        canvas. Now draw a yellow rectangle.**
      - Done see [Test.Scribe.CanvasDemo.assignment55](Test/Scribble/CanvasDemo.java)
 
 - 5.56 **How do you clear the whole canvas?**
    - By calling the `Canvas.clear()` method.
 
 - 5.57 **In class DrawDemo , create a new method named drawTriangle . This method should create a pen 
        (as in the drawSquare method) and then draw a green triangle.**
    - Done see [Test.Scribe.CanvasDemo.draw](Test/Scribble/CanvasDemo.java)
    
 - 5.58 **Write a method drawPagram that draws a pentagram to show your support of the beast :smiling_imp:`666`:smiling_imp:.**
    - Done see [Scribe.CanvasDemo.hailSatan()](Test/Scribble/ArtGeneratorTest.java)
 
 - 5.59 **Write a method drawPolygon(int n) that draws a regular polygon with n sides 
        (thus, n=3 draws a triangle, n=4 draws a square, etc.).**
       - Done see [ArtGenerator.drawPolygon()](Scribble/ArtGenerator.java)
 
 - 5.60 **Write a method called spiral that draws a spiral (see Figure 5.6).**
    - Done see [ArtGenerator.drawPolygon()](Scribble/ArtGenerator.java)
    
 - 5.61 **Add a method to your DrawDemo class that produces a picture on the can- vas directly 
        (without using a pen object). The picture can show anything you like, but should at least include some 
        shapes, different colors, and text. Use code completion in the process of entering your code.**
    - Done see [ArtGenerator.drawPolygon()](Scribble/ArtGenerator.java)
 
 - 5.62 **Change the method bounce in class BallDemo to let the user choose how many balls should be bouncing.**
    - Done see [BallsDemo](balls/BallDemo.java)
    
 - 5.63 **Which type of collection ( ArrayList , HashMap , or HashSet ) is most suita- ble for storing 
        the balls for the new bounce method? Discuss in writing, and justify your choice.**
        - an `ArrayList` will do it. because you want to make sure you get each ball.
  
 - 5.64 **Change the bounce method to place the balls randomly anywhere in the top half of the screen.**
    - Done see [BallsDemo](balls/BallDemo.java)
     
 - 5.65 **Write a new method named boxBounce . This method draws a rectangle (the “box”) on screen and one 
        or more balls inside the box. For the balls, do not use BouncingBall , but create a new class 
        BoxBall that moves around inside the box, bouncing off the walls of the box so that the ball 
        always stays inside. The initial position and speed of the ball should be random. The boxBounce 
        method should have a parameter that specifies how many balls are in the box.**
    - Done see my modified project [MyGame](MyGame/GameWorld.java)
    
 - 5.66 **Give the balls in boxBounce random colors**
    - Done see my modified project [MyGame](MyGame/GameWorld.java)
 - 5.67 **In class BouncingBall , you will find a definition of gravity (a simple inte- ger). Increase 
        or decrease the gravity value; compile and run the bouncing ball demo again. Do you observe a change**
   - Done see my modified project [MyGame](MyGame/GameWorld.java)
   
 - 5.68 **Write constant declarations for the following:** 
   - **A public variable that is used to measure tolerance, with the value 0.001.**
     ```java 
     public static final float TOLERANCE = 0.001f
     ```
   - **A private variable that is used to indicate a pass mark, with the integer value of 40.**
    ```java 
    public static final int PASS_MARK = 40
    ```
   - **A public character variable that is used to indicate that the help command is 'h' .**
     ```java 
     public static final String COMMAND_HELP = "h"  
     ```
 - 5.69 **Take a look at the LogEntry class in the weblog-analyzer project from Chapter 4. How have 
        constants been used in that class? Do you think that this is a good use of constants?**
        - Nope
 
 - 5.70 **Suppose that a change to the weblog-analyzer project meant that it was no longer necessary 
        to store year values in the dataValues array in the LogEntry class. How much of the class would 
        need to be altered if the month value were now to be stored at index 0 , the day value at index 1 , 
        and so on? Do you see how the use of named constants for spe- cial values simplifies this sort of process?**
        - A lot you have to go though the whole class to alter stuff.
 
 - 5.72 **There is a rumor circulating on the Internet that George Lucas (the creator of the Star Wars movies) 
        uses a formula to create the names for the characters in his stories (Jar Jar Binks, ObiWan Kenobi, etc.). 
        The formula—allegedly—is this: Your Star Wars first name: 1 Take the first three letters of your last name. 
        2 Add to that the first two letters of your first name. Your Star Wars last name: 1 Take the first 
        two letters of your mother’s maiden name. 2 Add to this the first three letters of the name of the town or 
        city where you were born. And now your task: Create a new BlueJ project named star-wars . 
        In it create a class named NameGenerator . This class should have a method named generateStarWarsName 
        that generates a Star Wars name, following the method described above. You will need to find out about a 
        method of the String class that generates a substring.**
        - Done see [The NameGenerator class](Starwars/NameGenerator.java) for the solution.
 
 - 5.73 **Assume that we want to swap the values of two integer variables, a and b. To do this, we write a 
        method public void swap(int i1, int i2) { int tmp = i1; i1 = i2; i2 = tmp; } Then we call this method 
        with our a and b variables: swap(a, b); Are a and b swapped after this call? If you test it, you will 
        notice that they are not! Why does this not work? Explain in detail.**
       - Because you are swapping an copy and not the the original values.
